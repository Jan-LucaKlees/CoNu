# CoNu
a game about connecting numbers, clearing all numbers on the field.

## How to play
Your goal is to connect and thus clear all numbers from the playing field.
The numbers you connect must have the same value or sum up to ten. Also they
ought to be neighbours in one of these way. They can be vertically or horizontally
adjacent, or sequentially, read from top left to bottom right. Numbers can be direct
neighbours, or indirectly with already connected numbers in between them. You can
connect them by first clicking on one number and then on the other one.

If you run out of numbers to connect, you can extend the playing field. Doing so all
unconnected numbers will be appended to the playing field, possibly enabling new connections.
